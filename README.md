# Personal AI Prompt Management Repository

This repository is designed to organize, store, and manage a personal collection of AI prompts. The structure is intentionally minimal and flexible, allowing categories and subfolders to emerge as your collection grows.

## Philosophy
- **No strict up-front categories:** Start with a single `prompts/` folder. Add subfolders only when you have enough prompts to justify them.
- **Markdown for prompts:** All prompts are stored as `.md` files for human readability and easy version control.
- **Iterative organization:** Refactor and reorganize as your needs evolve.
- **Documentation-first:** Use markdown for all documentation, logs, and guides.

## Initial Structure
```
prompts/           # All prompt files (markdown)
docs/              # Documentation, structure, dev logs
assets/            # Images, diagrams, supporting media
ToDo.md            # Task tracking (always up to date)
.gitignore         # Standard ignores
```

## Best Practices
- Add new categories or subfolders in `prompts/` as your needs evolve.
- Document major changes and reasoning in `docs/dev-logs.md`.
- Keep `ToDo.md` current and organized.
- Use version control for all changes.

## Getting Started
1. Add your first prompt as a markdown file in `prompts/`.
2. Update `ToDo.md` with your next steps.
3. Document any major decisions or experiments in `docs/dev-logs.md`.
