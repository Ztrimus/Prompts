**2025-08-10** — Initial repository structure created. Adopted a minimal, flexible folder structure for prompt management. Categories will be added iteratively as the collection grows. Based on best practices from community and industry research.

**2025-08-10** — Added two prompt files: `atomic_commit_workflow_prompt.md` and `copilot_instructions.md` to `prompts/`.

### Improvement Ideas
- Add prompt metadata (title, description, tags, model, etc.) at the top of each prompt file for easier search and management.
- Include input/output samples in each prompt file to document expected behavior and facilitate testing.
- As the collection grows, consider grouping prompts by use case, type, or workflow using subfolders.
- Optionally, maintain a prompt index or summary table in `README.md` or a separate file for quick navigation.
