# Repository Structure Philosophy

This repository uses a minimal, flexible folder structure for AI prompt management. Categories and subfolders are created only as the collection grows—no strict boundaries are set up front.

## Initial Structure

- `prompts/` — All prompt files (markdown format). Add subfolders as needed.
- `docs/` — Documentation, guides, and structure philosophy.
- `assets/` — Images, diagrams, or supporting media.
- `.gitignore` — Standard ignores for workspace hygiene.
- `ToDo.md` — Task tracking, always up to date.

## Guidelines
- Use markdown for all prompts and documentation.
- Add new categories or subfolders in `prompts/` as your needs evolve.
- Document major changes and reasoning in `docs/dev-logs.md`.
- Keep `ToDo.md` current and organized.

This approach is based on community best practices and is designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.
